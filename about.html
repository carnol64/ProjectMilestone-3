           <p>While volunteering with the Baptist Collegiate Ministry in March of 2022, Cameron and Anna Grace met over a four leaf clover.<br>
            From then, Cameron and Anna Grace became inseperable. From New York to Florida, their love carried them across the states, growing their bond with each passing day<br>
            After fifteen months together Cameron just could not wait a day longer and they were engaged in the Georgia Botanical Gardens, where they were later wed before the years end.</p>
